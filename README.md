# Vaultpass

The idea came from [Hashpass](https://github.com/boyers/hashpass) which generates site-specific password in chrome extension. And the algorithm of password generation in [Vault](https://github.com/jcoglan/vault/tree/0.3.0) is better and more mature. Vaultpass hopes to combine the easy-to-use of hashpass and better password generation of vault to create a chrome extension and mobile app using [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/).
